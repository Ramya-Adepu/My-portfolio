            <li><h3>Conways Game Of Life: Gaming Project Implemented</h3></li>
                <p>Game of Life (or just “Life”) is not really a game. There’s no winning or losing or destroying your opponent mentally and spiritually. Life is a “cellular automaton” - a system of cells that live on a grid, where they live, die and evolve according to the rules that govern their world.</p>

            <li><h3>Socket programming project: Web Server</h3></li>
                <p>socket programming project is developing concurrent network applications. The client program (the browsers) communicates with the server program (your web server) using HyperText Transport Protocol.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Web browsing that we experience today is a combination of multiple layers and technologies (such as wifi, ISPs, routing, DNS, reliable transport etc.).</li>
                    <li> At a higher level a webserver is a typical socket program that is capable of handling multiple client requests.</li>
                    <li>This project helps you think about numerous tasks that a networking application does for making a web server.</li>
                    <li>This will remove the mystery/magic of what the network does ‘underneath’ your web browsing.</li>
                    <li>In building this project, you will become familiar with HTTP.</li>
                </ul>

            <li><h3>Box and Dots: Gaming project Designed</h3></li>
                <p>The game starts with an empty grid of dots. Usually two players take turns adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots. A player who completes the fourth side of a 1×1 box earns one point and takes another turn. (A point is typically recorded by placing a mark that identifies the player in the box, such as an initial.) The game ends when no more lines can be placed. The winner is the player with the most points. The board may be of any size grid. When short on time, or to learn the game, a 2×2 board (3×3 dots) is suitable. A 5×5 board, on the other hand, is good for experts.</p>
